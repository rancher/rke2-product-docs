== Release v1.26.15+rke2r1

// v1.26.15+rke2r1

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.26.15+rke2r1[v1.26.15+rke2r1] release updates Kubernetes to v1.26.15.

=== Important Notes

--
* Canal uses flannel 0.24.3 which includes a bug: every 5 seconds it tries to add ipv6 iptables rules and fails if the node does not have an ipv6 address. The consequence is the log "Failed to ensure iptables rules: error setting up rules: failed to apply partial iptables-restore unable to run iptables-restore (, ): exit status 4" appears every 5 seconds in the flannel container of the canal pod.

* Flannel daemonset is not tolerating node taints: "node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute", "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule" and "node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized:NoSchedule" which can create problems when deploying with Rancher in certain cloud-providers (e.g. vShpere or DigitalOcean).

* If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.
+
You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
+
[,bash]
----
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
----

Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:

== Release v1.26.4+rke2r1

// v1.26.4+rke2r1

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.26.4+rke2r1[v1.26.4+rke2r1] release updates Kubernetes to v1.26.4, and fixes a number of issues.

=== Important Notes

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:

[,bash]
----
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token

// v1.26.2+rke2r1

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.26.2+rke2r1[v1.26.2+rke2r1] release updates Kubernetes to v1.26.2, and fixes a number of issues.

=== Changes since v1.26.1+rke2r1

* Remove pod logs as part of killall https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3821[(#3821)]
* Update channel server https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3853[(#3853)]
* Bump cilium images https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3802[(#3802)]

* Updated RKE2 README's header image to point to the new rke2-docs repo https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3727[(#3727)]
* Bump K3s version https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3897[(#3897)]
 ** Fixed an issue where leader-elected controllers for managed etcd did not run on etcd-only nodes
 ** RKE2 now functions properly when the cluster CA certificates are signed by an existing root or intermediate CA. You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before RKE2 starts in the K3s repo at https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/blob/master/contrib/util/certs.sh[contrib/util/certs.sh].
 ** RKE2 now supports `kubeadm` style join tokens. `rke2 token create` now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL.
 ** RKE2 agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster.
 ** ServiceLB now honors the Service's ExternalTrafficPolicy. When set to Local, the LoadBalancer will only advertise addresses of Nodes with a Pod for the Service, and will not forward traffic to other cluster members. (ServiceLB is still disabled by default)
* Bump K3s commit https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3905[(#3905)]
* Add bootstrap token auth handler https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3920[(#3920)]

 ** The embedded helm-controller job image now correctly handles upgrading charts that contain resource types that no longer exist on the target Kubernetes version. This includes properly handling removal of PodSecurityPolicy resources when upgrading from <= v1.24.
* Add sig-storage snapshot controller and validation webhook https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3944[(#3944)]
* Add a quick host-path CSI snapshot to the basic CI test https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3946[(#3946)]
* Update kubernetes to v1.26.2 https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3953[(#3953)]

== Release v1.26.1+rke2r1

// v1.26.1+rke2r1

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.26.1+rke2r1[v1.26.1+rke2r1] release updates Kubernetes to v1.26.1 to backport registry changes and fix two critical issues.

=== Important Notes

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

// v1.26.0+rke2r2

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.26.0+rke2r2[v1.26.0+rke2r2] release updates containerd to v1.6.14 to resolve an issue where pods would lose their CNI information when containerd was restarted.

=== Changes since v1.26.0+rke2r1

* Bump containerd to v1.6.14-k3s1 https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3746[(#3746)]
 ** The embedded containerd version has been bumped to v1.6.14-k3s1. This includes a backported fix for https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843[containerd/7843] which caused pods to lose their CNI info when containerd was restarted, which in turn caused the kubelet to recreate the pod.
 ** Windows agents now use the k3s fork of containerd, which includes support for registry rewrites.

== Release v1.26.0+rke2r1

// v1.26.0+rke2r1

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.26.0+rke2r1[v1.26.0+rke2r1] release is RKE2's first in the v1.26 line. This release updates Kubernetes to v1.26.0.

Before upgrading from earlier releases, be sure to read the Kubernetes https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.26.md#urgent-upgrade-notes[Urgent Upgrade Notes].

=== Important Notes

This release is affected by https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843, which causes the kubelet to restart all pods whenever RKE2 is restarted. For this reason, we have removed this RKE2 release from the channel server. Please use `v1.26.0+rke2r2` instead.
