== Release v1.27.16+rke2r2

// v1.27.16+rke2r2

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.27.16+rke2r2[v1.27.16+rke2r2] release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.16.

=== Important Notes

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:

[,bash]
----
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
----

== Release v1.27.14+rke2r1

// v1.27.14+rke2r1

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.27.14+rke2r1[v1.27.14+rke2r1] release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.14.

=== Important Notes

--
* If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.
+
You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
+
[,bash]
----
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.27.12+rke2r1[v1.27.12+rke2r1] release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.12.

=== Important Notes

--
* Canal uses flannel 0.24.3 which includes a bug: every 5 seconds it tries to add ipv6 iptables rules and fails if the node does not have an ipv6 address. The consequence is the log "Failed to ensure iptables rules: error setting up rules: failed to apply partial iptables-restore unable to run iptables-restore (, ): exit status 4" appears every 5 seconds in the flannel container of the canal pod.

* Flannel daemonset is not tolerating node taints: "node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute", "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule" and "node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized:NoSchedule" which can create problems when deploying with Rancher in certain cloud-providers (e.g. vShpere or DigitalOcean).

* If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.
+
You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:

* Addresses the runc CVE: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626[CVE-2024-21626] by updating runc to v1.1.12.
* If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.
+
You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:

== Release v1.27.4+rke2r1

// v1.27.4+rke2r1

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.27.4+rke2r1[v1.27.4+rke2r1] release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.4, and fixes a number of issues.

=== Important Notes

--
* If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.
+
You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
+
[,bash]
