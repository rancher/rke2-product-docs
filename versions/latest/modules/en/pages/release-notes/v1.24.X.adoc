== Release v1.24.17+rke2r1

// v1.24.17+rke2r1

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.24.17+rke2r1[v1.24.17+rke2r1] release updates Kubernetes to v1.24.17, and fixes a number of issues.

=== Important Notes

* ⚠️ This release includes support for remediating CVE-2023-32186, a potential Denial of Service attack vector on RKE2 servers. See https://github.com/rancher/rke2/security/advisories/GHSA-p45j-vfv5-wprq for more information, including mandatory steps necessary to harden clusters against this vulnerability.
* If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.
+
You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
+
[,bash]

* Bump k3s version https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3899[(#3899)]
 ** Fixed an issue where leader-elected controllers for managed etcd did not run on etcd-only nodes
 ** RKE2 now functions properly when the cluster CA certificates are signed by an existing root or intermediate CA. You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before RKE2 starts in the K3s repo at https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/blob/master/contrib/util/generate-custom-ca-certs.sh[contrib/util/certs.sh].
 ** RKE2 now supports `kubeadm` style join tokens. `rke2 token create` now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL.
 ** RKE2 agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster.
 ** ServiceLB now honors the Service's ExternalTrafficPolicy. When set to Local, the LoadBalancer will only advertise addresses of Nodes with a Pod for the Service, and will not forward traffic to other cluster members. (ServiceLB is still disabled by default)
* Bump K3s commit https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3907[(#3907)]
* Add bootstrap token auth handler https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3922[(#3922)]

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.24.10+rke2r1[v1.24.10+rke2r1] release updates Kubernetes to v1.24.10 to backport registry changes and fix two critical issues.

=== Important Notes

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup.

// v1.24.9+rke2r2

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.24.9+rke2r2[v1.24.9+rke2r2] release updates containerd to v1.6.14 to resolve an issue where pods would lose their CNI information when containerd was restarted.

=== Important Notes

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore.

=== Changes since v1.24.9+rke2r1

* Bump containerd to v1.6.14-k3s1 https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3747[(#3747)]
 ** The embedded containerd version has been bumped to v1.6.14-k3s1. This includes a backported fix for https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843[containerd/7843] which caused pods to lose their CNI info when containerd was restarted, which in turn caused the kubelet to recreate the pod.
 ** Windows agents now use the k3s fork of containerd, which includes support for registry rewrites.

[CAUTION]
====
This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.24.9+rke2r1[v1.24.9+rke2r1] release is affected by https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843, which causes the kubelet to restart all pods whenever RKE2 is restarted. For this reason, we have removed this RKE2 release from the channel server. Please use `v1.24.9+rke2r2` instead.
====

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.24.9, fixes a number of minor issues, and includes security updates.

=== Important Notes

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup.

== Release v1.24.8+rke2r1

// v1.24.8+rke2r1

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.24.8+rke2r1[v1.24.8+rke2r1] release updates Kubernetes to v1.24.8, fixes a number of minor issues, and includes security updates.

=== Important Notes

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:

[,bash]

cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
