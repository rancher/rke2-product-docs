FIPS 140-3 is a U.S. Federal Government security standard used to approve cryptographic modules. This document explains how RKE2 is built with FIPS validated cryptographic libraries.

Verification of compliance is avaliable in: xref:attachment$RKE2_FIPS3_Verified.pdf[FIPS 140-3 Verifed].

== Use of FIPS Compatible Go compiler

The Go compiler being used can be found https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/dev.boringcrypto[here]. Each component of the system is built with the version of this compiler that matches the same standard Go compiler version that would be used otherwise.

This version of Go replaces the standard Go crypto libraries with the FIPS validated BoringCrypto module. See GoBoring's https://go.dev/src/crypto/internal/boring/README[readme] for more details. This module is validated by NIST as the https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4407[BoringCrypto] module on a wide range of systems.

=== FIPS Support in Cluster Components

Most RKE2 components are statically compiled using the GoBoring Go compiler. Architecturally, RKE2 is divided into several sections, and the following list outlines these sections and their associated components:

* Kubernetes
 ** API Server
 ** Controller Manager
 ** Scheduler
 ** Kubelet
 ** Kube Proxy
 ** Metric Server
 ** Kubectl
* Helm Charts
 ** Flannel
 ** Calico
 ** CoreDNS
 ** Traefik

== Runtime

To ensure the entire architecture utilizes FIPS 140-3 compliant algorithms, RKE2 runtime utilities are statically compiled with the FIPS-enabled Go compiler. This guarantees compliance across every level of the stack, from Kubernetes daemons to container orchestration mechanics.

* etcd
* containerd
 ** containerd-shim
 ** containerd-shim-runc-v1
 ** containerd-shim-runc-v2
 ** ctr
* crictl
* runc

== CNI

RKE2 supports selecting an alternative CNI via the `--cni` flag. It comes bundled with several options, including Canal (default), Calico, Cilium, and Multus. However, only Canal is rebuilt for FIPS compliance.

== Ingress

RKE2 ships with a FIPS-compliant NGINX as its default ingress provider. There are two primary sub-components:

* Controller: Responsible for monitoring/updating Kubernetes resources and configuring the server accordingly.
* Server: Responsible for accepting and routing traffic.

The controller is written in Go and is compiled using our <<Use of FIPS Compatible Go compiler,FIPS compatible Go compiler>>.

The server is written in C and depends on OpenSSL to function properly. As a result, it leverages a FIPS-validated version of OpenSSL to achieve FIPS compliance.
