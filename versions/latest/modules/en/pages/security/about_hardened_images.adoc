RKE2 hardened images are scanned for vulnerabilities at build time, and additional security protections have been added to decrease potential weaknesses:

* Images are not simply mirrored from upstream builds. The images are built from source on top of a hardened minimal base image, which is currently https://www.suse.com/products/base-container-images/[SLE Base Container Image (BCI)].
* Any binaries that are written in Go are compiled using a FIPS 140-2 compliant build process. For more information on this compiler, refer xref:./fips_support.adoc#use-of-fips-compatible-go-compiler[here].

You will know if an image has been hardened as above by the image name. RKE2 publishes image lists with each release. Refer https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/download/v1.23.14%2Brke2r1/rke2-images-all.linux-amd64.txt[here] for an example of a published image list.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, RKE2 hardened images are multi-architecture. Only the Linux AMD64 architecture is FIPS compliant. Windows and s390x architectures are not FIPS compliant.
