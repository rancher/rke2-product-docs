RKE2 can be run on SELinux-enabled systems which is the default when installed on CentOS/RHEL 7 & 8. The https://github.com/rancher/rke2-selinux[policy] supporting this is a specialization of the https://github.com/containers/container-selinux[container-selinux] policy for containerd. It accounts for the non-standard location(s) which containerd is installed and places persistent and ephemeral state.

[NOTE] 
====
In some circumstances, a reboot of the node may be required after installing the rke2-selinux package and before starting the rke2 service. If you encounter denials in your selinux audit log despite installation of the rke2-selinux and container-selinux packages, please reboot the node.

== Custom Context Labels

RKE2 runs control-plane services as static pods which require access to multiple https://github.com/containers/container-selinux/blob/RHEL7.5/container.te#L59[`container_var_lib_t`] locations. The `etcd` container must be able to read-write under `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db` and read, along with `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager`, and `kube-scheduler`, from `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls`. To make this work without over-privileging, e.g., https://github.com/containers/container-selinux/blob/RHEL7.5/container.te#L47-L49[`spc_t`], the RKE2 SELinux policy introduces the https://github.com/rancher/rke2-selinux/blob/v0.3.latest.1/rke2.te#L15-L21[`rke2_service_db_t`] and https://github.com/rancher/rke2-selinux/blob/v0.3.latest.1/rke2.te#L9-L13[`rke2_service_t`] context labels for read-write and read-only access, respectively. These labels will only be applied to the RKE2 control-plane static pods.

== Specific OS Requirements

=== Amazon Linux 2

Amazon Linux 2 requires additional selinux packages to be installed:

[,bash]
----
sudo amazon-linux-extras enable selinux-ng; sudo yum install selinux-policy-targeted -y
----

== Configuration

RKE2 support for SELinux amounts to a single configuration item, the `--selinux` boolean flag. This is a pass-through to the https://github.com/containerd/cri/blob/release/1.4/docs/config.md[`enable_selinux` boolean in the cri section of the containerd/cri toml]. If RKE2 was installed via tarball then SELinux will not be enabled without additional configuration. The recommended method to configure such is via an entry in the RKE2 `config.yaml`, e.g.:

[,yaml]
----
# /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml is the default location
selinux: true
----

This is equivalent to passing the `--selinux` flag to `rke2 server` or `rke2 agent` command-line or setting the `RKE2_SELINUX=true` environment variable.
