RKE2 ships several CLI tools to help with accessing and debugging the cluster. On startup they are extracted to `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin`.

== kubectl

An admin kubeconfig is generated at `/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml`.

Example:

[,bash]
----
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml
/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get nodes
----

== Containerd

RKE2 ships with `ctr` and `crictl`. The Containerd socket is located at `/run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock`.

Examples:

[,bash]
----
/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/ctr --address /run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock --namespace k8s.io container ls
----
[,bash]
----
export CRI_CONFIG_FILE=/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/etc/crictl.yaml
/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/crictl ps
----
