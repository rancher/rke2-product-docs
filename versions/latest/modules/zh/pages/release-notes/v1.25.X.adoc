== Release v1.25.16+rke2r2

// v1.25.16+rke2r2

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.25.16+rke2r2[v1.25.16+rke2r2] release is a special security release addressing a runc CVE.

=== Important Notes

Addresses the runc CVE: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626[CVE-2024-21626] by updating runc to v1.1.12.

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:

[,bash]
----
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
----

=== Changes since v1.25.16+rke2r1

* Update runc https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/5509[(#5509)]

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.25.13+rke2r1[v1.25.13+rke2r1] release updates Kubernetes to v1.25.13, and fixes a number of issues.

=== Important Notes

⚠️ This release includes support for remediating CVE-2023-32186, a potential Denial of Service attack vector on RKE2 servers. See https://github.com/rancher/rke2/security/advisories/GHSA-p45j-vfv5-wprq for more information, including mandatory steps necessary to harden clusters against this vulnerability.
If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:

* Bump K3s version https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3898[(#3898)]
 ** Fixed an issue where leader-elected controllers for managed etcd did not run on etcd-only nodes
 ** RKE2 now functions properly when the cluster CA certificates are signed by an existing root or intermediate CA. You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before RKE2 starts in the K3s repo at https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/blob/master/contrib/util/generate-custom-ca-certs.sh[contrib/util/certs.sh].
 ** RKE2 now supports `kubeadm` style join tokens. `rke2 token create` now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL.
 ** RKE2 agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster.
 ** ServiceLB now honors the Service's ExternalTrafficPolicy. When set to Local, the LoadBalancer will only advertise addresses of Nodes with a Pod for the Service, and will not forward traffic to other cluster members. (ServiceLB is still disabled by default)
* Bump K3s commit https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3906[(#3906)]
* Add bootstrap token auth handler https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3921[(#3921)]
* Bump helm-controller/klipper-helm https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3937[(#3937)]
 ** The embedded helm-controller job image now correctly handles upgrading charts that contain resource types that no longer exist on the target Kubernetes version. This includes properly handling removal of PodSecurityPolicy resources when upgrading from <= v1.24.
* Add sig-storage snapshot controller and validation webhook https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3943[(#3943)]
* Add a quick host-path CSI snapshot to the basic CI test https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3947[(#3947)]

== Release v1.25.3+rke2r1

// v1.25.3+rke2r1

This https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.25.3+rke2r1[v1.25.3+rke2r1] release update Kubernetes to v1.25.3+rke2r1, fixes a number of minor issues, and includes security updates.

=== Important Notes

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:

[,bash]
----
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token

* Kubernetes v1.25 removes the beta `PodSecurityPolicy` admission plugin. Please follow the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/migrate-from-psp/[upstream documentation] to migrate from PSP if using the built-in PodSecurity Admission Plugin, prior to upgrading to v1.25.0+rke2r1.
* RKE2 now supports version 1.23 of the CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes. The legacy CIS 1.5 and 1.6 profiles (`profile: cis-1.5` and `profile: cis-1.6`) have been removed as they do not apply to Kubernetes 1.25. Servers using one of the legacy profiles must be updated to specify the `cis-1.23` profile when upgrading to RKE2 1.25, or RKE2 will fail to start.
